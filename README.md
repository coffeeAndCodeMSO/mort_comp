# The goal  

Without spending a single $, put a site on the internet, add google adwords, get ads,
get clicks, get a check from google with $ and use it to buy pizza+beer for a meeting.
Extra money if there is any can be used to fund a bank account for the group.

# The proposed site for doing this

This is a single-page static react app.

It compares using a 15 year mortgage to a 30 year mortgage in order to help
potential mortgage buyers make a choice between the two.

It is based on this google spreadsheet prototype: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QJ2q4COKFGKp_gkkeBdNC1ywlGU6AKxgD8EnJ08Z3hs/edit?usp=sharing
