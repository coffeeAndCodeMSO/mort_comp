# MSO Code Club - Mortgage comparison tool

Here is where the site be... for now :)
https://coffeeandcodemso.github.io/mort_comp/

## The goal of this project

Without spending a single $, put a site on the internet, add google adwords, get ads,
get clicks, get a check from google for $100+, and with that $ and use it to buy pizza+beer for a meeting/party.
Extra money if there is any can be used to fund a bank account for the group.

**AND** along the way learn lots of cool stuff like ReactJS, CSS, GitHub Pages,
TravisCI, Google Analytics, Google AdWords, website marketing, etc etc.  
And do it together.

# The proposed site for doing this

This is a single-page static react app.

It compares using a 15 year mortgage to a 30 year mortgage in order to help
potential mortgage buyers make a choice between the two.

It is based on this google spreadsheet prototype: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QJ2q4COKFGKp_gkkeBdNC1ywlGU6AKxgD8EnJ08Z3hs/edit?usp=sharing
